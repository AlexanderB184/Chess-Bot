#for chess-lib

draw by repetition not supported

make a game structure of some sort, keeping track of previous board states, potentially add unmake_move and use throughout instead of copymake

gui is lacking, want to support unicode chess characters and use escape characters to replace board in place

replace can_be_attacked_by with a more sophisticated method, tracking pins and such and storing in parallel data structure

create bitboard data structure and replace current board structure

use magic bitboards

#for bot

improve static_evaluation function

  improve piece-square values

  seperate mid-game/end-game piece-square values

  add special considerations for pawns (maybe other pieces but pawns have the most complexity e.g. don't push pawns in front of the king, doubled pawns and isolated pawns are weak, passed pawns are good)
  
add delta pruning to quiescence search

implement primary variation search
